This repository contains an app that is used to track working hours in Jira.
The app is built with React Native (`react-native-macos`) and uses Jira.js for Jira API interactions.
Most of the code is inside the `src` directory since that folder contains the React Native app.
Platform-specific code is in the `macos` directory, since we are developing this for macOS.
There also is a windows version of the app in the `windows` directory, but it is not currently being maintained.
